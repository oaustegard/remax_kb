"""A tiny harness for gates that can actually fail.

Vendored verbatim (stdlib-only, designed to be copied) so the gates in this
directory run in CI without an extra dependency.

The whole point of a gate is to go red when it should.  The characteristic
failure is not a wrong check — it is a check that *cannot* fail, which reports
PASS forever and reads exactly like a working one.

So this harness refuses to let a gate pass unless it registered at least one
`known_bad` case that its own criteria rejected.  A gate with no known-bad is
reported as INCONCLUSIVE and exits non-zero, because "nothing looked wrong" is
not evidence when nothing could have looked wrong.

    from gate import Gate

    g = Gate("codebook calibration")

    g.anchor("scalar quantizer, 2 bits", measured=0.117482, published=0.1175,
             rel_tol=2e-3, source="Max (1960) table 1")

    g.bracket("trained grid sits between scalar and the Shannon bound",
              value=0.0887, lo=0.0625, hi=0.1175,
              why="must beat scalar; cannot beat the rate-distortion bound")

    g.known_bad("an under-trained grid is rejected",
                rejected=under_trained_mse > threshold,
                detail=f"{under_trained_mse:.5f} > {threshold:.5f}")

    g.coverage("Max's table stops at 5 bits — rates above that are unanchored")

Stdlib only.  Import it, or copy the class into your gate script; it is small

        **Validate it at the configuration it will actually run in.**  A
